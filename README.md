Food Finder
===========

##About
The food finder project is my first attempt at creating something interactive with Ruby. This is also my first time pushing something original up to GitHub after working on it locally. This is a command prompt program, not a Rails project. Feel free to download the files and then run 'Ruby init.rb' to access the program.
